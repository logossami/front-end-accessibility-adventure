# Front End Accessibility Adventure (in Finnish)

Storified and Lightweight Learning Material on Accessibility for Front End Developers (mainly HTML / CSS).

*** PROJECT LANGUAGE IS FINNISH ***

This project was a carried out as an exercise for my Orientation to Digital Technologies course at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, Finland in Autumn 2020. This is a storified web page project showcasing some HTML and CSS and focusing on accessibility. It was my intention to apply more JS as well but, as it turned out, there was no time for that.

The story is very much tongue-in-cheek, a classic tale of good vs. evil, knights and sages vs. demons, all in the context of accessible web design. I have not strived towards any design standards, as the focus here is on accessibility, but some UX/UI analysis was still made, especially in mobile vs. desktop. 

The pictures are open source and their links should be visible in the material. But, alas, the story is in Finnish, I am sorry for that! :)

The version here is not without errors, there's at least a couple of them. I acknowledge any feedback and suggestions to improve the material!
