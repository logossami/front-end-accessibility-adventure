# Front End Accessibility Adventure (in Finnish)

Storified and Lightweight Learning Material on Accessibility for Front End Developers (mainly HTML / CSS).

*** PROJECT LANGUAGE IS FINNISH ***

This project was a carried out as an exercise for my Orientation to Digital Technologies course at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, Finland in Autumn 2020. This is a storified web page project showcasing some HTML and CSS and focusing on accessibility. It was my intention to apply more JS as well but, as it turned out, there was no time for that.

The story is very much tongue-in-cheek, a classic tale of good versus evil and knights versus demons, in the context of accessible web design. The pictures are open source and their sources should be visible in the material. But, alas, this is done in Finnish, I am sorry for that! :)

The version here is not without errors, I know there's at least a couple of them. I acknowledge any feedback and suggestions to improve the material!

BR,
Sami
